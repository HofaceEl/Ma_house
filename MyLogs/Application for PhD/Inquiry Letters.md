**Re: To Ross Maguire in Illinois**

Dear Professor Maguire,

Thank you so much for your reply! (It is a considerate one which helps a lot!)

As I was said in my CV, the sensitivity kernel work was my major experience, but I have been interested in the ambient noise imaging and fascinated by its theoretical simplicity and effectiveness. I had learnt it through several materials and done the mathematical derivation my own. I have just started my graduation project regarding it recently.

To the field I have learnt so far, the magmatic systems tomography is just the right topic(apatite) I would like to work on in a PhD program. But my current background is limited. Would it be nice (ask question after reading his work)

Again, thank you for your generous time and consideration and I am looking forward to your reply.

Sincerely,
Jiajun

Dear Professor Jia,

Hope this email finds you well. I am Jiajun Chen, a geophysics undergraduate from Wuhan University graduating next June. Attached is my CV.

I am interested in seismology and geodynamics. On knowing that you are going to take a new PhD student next fall, I was wondering if you can arrange an unofficial interview or something like that for me.

Thank you for your time and consideration. Look forward to your reply.

Sincerely,

Jiajun
