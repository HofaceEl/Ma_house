To Whom It May Concern,

It is my great pleasure to recommend Jiajun Chen for admission in [Geophysics] at [University]. I am his [Bachelor advisor] at Wuhan university who have closely interacted with him [since 2023]. As an undergraduate, he is found to be an intelligent and hardworking student, who has great potential to succeed in academia. Inasmuch as demonstrated above, I fully endorse his Ph.D. application with my strongest recommendation. [section generalized for all letters]

Jiajun has primarily worked on modeling the temporal variations in Rayleigh wave velocities following previous work of our group. To be more specific, he centered on examining the sensitivity kernels of surface wave velocities to S-wave velocities to confirm if the mathematical setting is well developed. He turned to plenty of articles about how to derive the expression of the relative perturbations in phase velocities, as well as programs for approaching it. [, finding that the intermediate method to yield group velocities may be incomplete for not using all parameters. This suggests that the expression for phase velocities, which involves group velocities in its derivation, is also called into question. (conclusion may be questioned, so hung here)]

Jiajun’s work firmly highlights his solid foundation of professional knowledge and his desire to explore the unknown. Before he dived into the sensitivity kernel part, he quickly reproduced the existing profile of the stress sensitivity parameter, demonstrating his keen and precise understanding of research, strong basis and efficient execution through simple and straightforward MATLAB setups. Besides that, Jiajun has the tendency to try different techniques on [need ‘on’ to emphasize?] regarding programing, including but not limited to GIS processing and network programing and can always push his projects as fast as possible.

Jiajun is deeply passionate about his interests, consistently solving and interpreting problems with remarkable precision. I was impressed during our conversations when he described how he developed ingenious solutions for a minor coursework assignment. He thrives on challenging himself with various geophysics problems that captivate him, tackling them with enthusiasm and excellence. His passion for exploring the Earth is evident in his willingness to invest necessary time and effort for time-consuming problems, which leads to the attainment of significant results ultimately.

Throughout the modeling project, Jiajun has also participated in discussions of interpretation for the sensitivity parameter regarding effective stress and S-wave velocity variation, during which he shows great motivation and willingness for teamwork. He compiled a detailed and articulate handbook on the gist of geophysical data analysis for his classmates when he was taking my course, proving that he is a generous and friendly candidate for collaboration programs. [maybe put in the front? Kind of weird…]

Overall, I believe Jiajun is a student with great potential in future research. He has been always passionate about his research and geoscience, expanding his knowledge and understanding in seismology and tectonics. He has consistently demonstrated his capacity to conduct rigorous research and find solutions to challenges. [University] is renowned for its strong [program], offering great position for the brightest students to achieve their excellence. I firmly believe that Jiajun’s adaptability will be well coupled with your outstanding program, which will enable him to mature into an exceptional scientist.

Jiajun has my strongest recommendation. If you require any further information, please do not hesitate to contact me.

Sincerely,

**Letter of Recommendation**

To the Admissions Committee,

I am pleased to write this letter of recommendation for Jiajun, who I have had the privilege of teaching and supervising over the past few years. 

Jiajun has shown impressive analytical skills and teamwork in research. His contributions to our discussions were insightful since he has joined my research group, and his ability to offer perspectives on the ongoing work showcased his analytical skills and collaborative mindset. His involvement was integral to the progress we made, and his capacity for teamwork stood out clearly.

His development as a professional was further enhanced when I invited him to attend the DEEP 2024 international meeting in Beijing. This experience allowed him to engage with the global academic community and present research findings, while also learning how to communicate effectively with fellow researchers. His enthusiasm for deepening his knowledge was evident through the intensive questions he asked me about the field of seismology. 

In addition to his outstanding performance in academics, Jiajun has shown great enthusiasm in both courses and field study. During my course, Fundamental of Geophysical Data Analysis, where he earned a remarkable score of 98 out of 100, he performed a great capability on data analysis. During our field study in Yunnan, China, he approached the geological buries with grand passion, showing his keen interest in connecting theoretical knowledge to applications.

Overall, Jiajun is an exceptional student who excels in both academic and research settings. His intellectual rigor, research contributions, and ability to communicate and collaborate effectively make him an ideal candidate for graduate studies. I am confident that he will continue to excel and make significant contributions to the field of geophysics.
