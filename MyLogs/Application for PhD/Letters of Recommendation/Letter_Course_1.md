**Letter of Recommendation**

To the Admissions Committee,

I am writing to offer my strong recommendation for [Your Name], who was a student in my Geodynamics course during the 1st term of the 2023 semester. [Your Name] earned a final score of 95 out of 100, which reflects their excellent grasp of the material and their dedication to academic excellence.

A key aspect of [Your Name]’s performance in the course was their involvement in a group presentation, where they worked closely with a peer throughout the entire process, from the selection of the article to the final presentation. [Your Name] demonstrated leadership by selecting the article, which explored modeling fault-parallel surface velocity, and took charge of coordinating the communication within the team. Their ability to guide the team, as well as their insight in identifying the key points and limitations of the academic article, highlighted their strong teamwork and analytical skills.

Following the presentation, we had a valuable discussion on the content of the article. [Your Name] showed great initiative in seeking additional feedback and clarification, which led to the creation of a well-organized summary book that captured the course material in a clear and structured manner. This demonstrated not only their attention to detail but also their commitment to deepening their understanding of the subject beyond the classroom.

Although the course did not involve solving a specific academic research problem, [Your Name]’s proactive approach to learning and their ability to work effectively in a team suggest that they are well-prepared for the challenges of graduate-level studies. They have expressed interest in applying to The University of Texas at Austin, where I spent my postdoctoral years and collaborated with several faculty members. I believe that [Your Name] would be a valuable addition to the program and would thrive in the collaborative and research-oriented environment at UT Austin.

Please feel free to contact me if you need further information.

Sincerely,
Professor Luo

Department of [Your Department]
[Your University]
